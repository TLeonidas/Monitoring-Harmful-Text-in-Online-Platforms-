# Monitoring-Harmful-Text-in-Online-Platforms-

You can [check the Notebook](https://github.com/TLeonidas/Monitoring-Harmful-Text-in-Online-Platforms-/blob/main/clf_andRandom_forest_Ensemble.ipynb) with its last outputs, or download it and upload the [necessary files](https://github.com/TLeonidas/Monitoring-Harmful-Text-in-Online-Platforms-/tree/main/notebook_files) before running it.

I used T4 GPU and high RAM to "wrap" RoBERTa model, which was not used for the predictions due to its low performance. Thus, you should be fine running it with just high RAM.

This project aims to address the increasing challenge of monitoring and managing the vast amount of user-generated content on various online platforms.

The project involves developing a machine learning model capable of analyzing texts as they are posted on social media, forums, and other digital communication channels. By utilizing advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the model will be trained to identify various types of content, such as hate speech, spam, phishing attempts, and legitimate messages. The goal is to create a system that can adapt to the evolving language and nuances of online communication, providing a scalable solution for content moderation.

This will help protect users from exposure to harmful content but also assist platform administrators in maintaining a healthy digital environment. The project aims to set a new standard for real-time text classification in online spaces.
